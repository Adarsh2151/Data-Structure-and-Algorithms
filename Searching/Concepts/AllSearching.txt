All searching algorithm are there

Linear Search - go through all element one by one 
    for i in array:
        if i == match:
            return True

    Time complexity for linear Search in worst case is O(n)

Binary Search - it works on monotoring function (organised order ascending or descending order)
    Our Approach-
        first find mid element and compare with key: return index
        if key > mid then take the right part:again go recursively
        if key < mid then take the left part:again go recursively
        return Not Found
        
    the Drawbacks - 
        * If there exit repeated element
