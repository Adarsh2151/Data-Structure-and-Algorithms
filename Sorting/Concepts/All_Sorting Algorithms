Sorting algorithm is very famous to Algorithm where we have to organised things in any order.
There are many Sorting Algorithm exist some of them are:
1. Selection Sort -

Selection Sort - 
    - insert the ith minimum value at ith position by swapping
    first take the 0 th index then check the minimum in rest if found then swap further go to n - 1 index
    - Time complexity is O(n2) same in best case and worst case

    Use Case - If size of arr is small
    
    Create FlowChart of this algorithm
